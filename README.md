## Welcome to my profile :)
I'm an amateur programmer who makes dumb projects and tries his best to learn how to code.

> Two Dudes Programming is an "organization" me and my friend made to manage our projects. So it's not really a big deal, but I thought it would be nice to include it in my profile description
